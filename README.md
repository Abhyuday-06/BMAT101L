# Multivariable Calculus Course

This repository contains a collection of MATLAB scripts for a multivariable calculus course. These scripts cover a wide range of topics, from basic vector operations to advanced concepts like Lagrange multipliers and multiple integrals. They are designed to help students visualize and understand the fundamental principles of multivariable calculus.

## Course Topics

The course covers the following topics:

*   **Vectors and Vector Operations:** Basic vector operations and visualization.
*   **Partial Derivatives:** Computing and visualizing partial derivatives of multivariable functions.
*   **Lagrange Multipliers:** Finding the extrema of a function subject to constraints.
*   **Multiple Integrals:** Calculating double and triple integrals to find the volume of solids.
*   **Parametric Curves and Surfaces:** Plotting and analyzing parametric equations.
*   **Optimization:** Finding the minimum and maximum values of functions of two variables.

## MATLAB Scripts

Here is a list of the MATLAB scripts included in this repository, along with a brief description of their purpose:

*   `Lagrange_Multiplier.m`: Finds the extrema of a function `f(x, y)` subject to a constraint `g(x, y) = 0` using the method of Lagrange multipliers.
*   `integration_one_curve.m`: Calculates the area under a single curve.
*   `integration_rsums.m`: Approximates the area under a curve using Riemann sums.
*   `integration_two_curves.m`: Calculates the area between two curves.
*   `minmax.m`: Finds the minimum and maximum values of a single-variable function.
*   `minmaxtwovariable.m`: Finds the minimum and maximum values of a two-variable function.
*   `multiple_graphs_display.m`: Displays multiple graphs in a single figure.
*   `parametric_plotting.m`: Plots parametric curves in 2D and 3D.
*   `partial_derivative.m`: Calculates and visualizes partial derivatives of a multivariable function.
*   `vectors.m`: Performs basic vector operations and visualizations.
*   `volume_of_2d_curve_rotation.m`: Calculates the volume of a solid generated by rotating a 2D curve around an axis.
*   `volume_solid_revolve.m`: Calculates the volume of a solid of revolution.
*   `multiple_integrals/double_integration.m`: Calculates and visualizes double integrals.
*   `multiple_integrals/triple_integration.m`: Calculates and visualizes triple integrals.
*   `multiple_integrals/viewSolid.m`: A helper function for visualizing solids.
*   `multiple_integrals/viewSolidone.m`: Another helper function for visualizing solids.

## How to Use

To use these MATLAB scripts, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download MATLAB from the official MathWorks website.

Once you have MATLAB installed, you can follow these steps:

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory where you cloned the repository.
3.  Open any of the MATLAB scripts in the MATLAB editor.
4.  Run the script by clicking the "Run" button or by typing the name of the script in the MATLAB command window and pressing "Enter."

You can modify the scripts to work with different functions and parameters. Each script is well-commented to help you understand the code and make changes.
